        description: "A full-stack system built with Go (Gin, GORM), PostgreSQL, and React (Vite + TypeScript) that simulates real-world ride-sharing dynamics. It enables riders to request trips, assigns the nearest available driver, and dynamically adjusts pricing with surge logic. The app supports role-based dashboards for admin, driver, and rider, integrates real-time ride updates via WebSockets, and lays the foundation for ETA simulation, payment gateway integration, and live Google Maps tracking.",
