  description: "I’m Pari Nagpal. I love building, breaking, and bettering digital experiences. I’m currently working in Federated Large Language Models (Fed LLMs) — exploring how distributed intelligence can make AI smarter, safer, and more collaborative. I love tackling complex challenges, experimenting with emerging technologies, and turning ideas into intelligent, user-driven solutions. Always curious, always building — that’s my favorite loop. ",
